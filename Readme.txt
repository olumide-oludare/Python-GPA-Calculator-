GPA Calculator in Python
This is a simple GPA calculator that allows student to input the details of their courses, including the course code, title, score, and unit, and calculates their GPA based on a 5.0 scale.

Requirements
Python 3.x

Input the number of courses you are taking and then enter the details for each course, including the course code, title, score (in numerical form), and unit.
The script will print out the details of the courses entered, as well as the calculated GPA.

Note:
The script uses a predefined mapping of numerical scores to letter grades based on a 5.0 scale.
The script only accepts valid numerical scores (0-100). Invalid input will result in an error.
The calculated GPA is rounded to 2 decimal places.


This is an example of how the gpa_calculator looks like after taking in the inputs.
